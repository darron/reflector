Want to create QR codes and measure how they're used?

Install Reflector. (Needs Ruby, Padrino, MySQL and Redis)
Setup your DB in config/database.rb
Setup your Redis installation in config/redis.yml
Setup your admin account in db/seeds.rb

```padrino rake dm:migrate
padrino rake seed
```

Create a "redirect" in /admin/.
Click on the "Show" link for a redirect and grab the generated QR Code.
Scan the QR Code - that logs a simple counter in Redis.


TODO - patches welcome: 

REDIS_NAMESPACE so we can run multiple installations in the same db.
Multiple users with different QRCodes.
More granular daily stats - sparklines - logging but not displayed.
to_i(36) - for better randomness for the urls.

But it's working great and seems to do the trick for today.
